# Sky Defense
Missles are raining from the sky, aimed at the cities below. It is up to you to shoot them down before they can cause damage.  
Fight fire with fire... or missiles in this case.

This is a self-imposed exercise. It is my attempt at recreating the arcade game *Missile Command*\*.  
With this project, I intend on improving my skills in the following:
* Game Development in general
* The Godot game engine
* Recreating old video games
* Applying refactoring techniques onto written code
* Making a game the looks *finished*

*\*To be more specific, I plan on this recreation being more similar to the Atari 2600 version than the original arcade version, since that seems to be not just a popular version of the game, but also appears slightly more simple to emulate. At the very least this project might end up as a mix between the two.*
